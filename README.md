# What is it?

This tool helps developers improve productivity by managing commonly used commands and notes. 

# Why?

Sometimes we forget a command we used in the past. You can quickly store them with this tool in case you need to reference them again. You can store other information 
too such as ip addresses, api end points, links, and much more to recollect at a later time. 

Yes you can save this in a file or document but sometimes those can be misplaced.

# How to use
First run the following commands:

```sh
Install python3 on machine
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
chmod +x src/cli_vault.py
